introText = "Born in 1925, Gabriel Cuallado is considered one of the most outstanding representatives of the movement of the renovation of Spanish photography of the second half of the 20th century. Among the most outstanding features of his work is the humanist and poetry-laden look with which he portrayed the gray reality of post-war Spanish society. Far from the great events, Cuallado focused on the intimate and close details of everyday life, through photographs of his friends, family and anonymous people. His most prolific years were those comprised in the decades of the fifties, sixties and seventies, in which he signed photographic series set in Madrid, Paris and Asturias."

text = "Photography has always been surrounded by the mystery of simplicity. The grasping simplicity of Walker Evans of André Kertesz of Manuel Álvarez of Gabriel Cualladó. Not the transfiguration itself but the photographic humility. Today, we have enough historical perspective to acknowledge that it is precisely between these things that lies the greatest. Those who have looked directly in the eyes of photography, to what photography really pretends to be. \nIn Cualladó, beauty lies within the fact of being there, simply there, whether it is standing up or sitting down.\nIn Cualladó, just like in Paul Strand, all of the people and things are in the highest moment of calm, severity’s simplicity of humble solemnity."

text = "Born of horticulturist parents, in a small Spanish village, Cuallado grew up in a tangled, authoritarian Spain. Enveloped by the smell of his father’s oranges, while watching his country’s austerity blaze in Franco’s dictatorship; his childhood was deeply marked by a frugal rigidity. In 1941, he traveled to Madrid to work at his uncle’s company, marking the beginning of his cosmopolitan journey."

After integrating Madrid’s Real Photographic Society (RSF) in 1956, Cuallado joined the renowned Afal Group of photographers. Together, they started the Movement of the Renovation of Spanish Photography.
